## Custom Observers

Most of the core functionalities of Rackio are based on the Observer Pattern, in which tags are observed for new changes, after these changes some operations are made. You can define your own Custom Observer functions, in which it is required to be executed after a new value for a tag has occurred, this can be used for those tasks or commands that the Rackio math parser can not handle, like some Neural Network evaluation.
